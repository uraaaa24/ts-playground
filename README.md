# PG.js Constellation (TypeScript)

A tiny TypeScript "artwork" that paints a `PG.js` constellation in the terminal. No database is required.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

If you previously installed the database-backed version, remove old dependencies first:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules pnpm-lock.yaml
pnpm install
```

## Run

```bash
pnpm dev
```
